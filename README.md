The tasks that were completed included: 
(1) Pre-hardening steps: System inventory and backup
(2) Auditing users and groups
(3) Updating and enforcing password policies
(4) Updating and enforcing sudo permissions
(5) Validating and updating permissions on files and directories.
(6) Auditing and securing SSH
(7) Reviewing and updating system packages
(8) Disabling unnecessary services
(9) Enabling and configuring logging
(10) Scripting your hardening tasks
(11) Scheduling your hardening scripts
(12) Completing the summary report

The completed report is included in this repository labeled as a technical brief
